This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `box-cell-setup.ipynb`,
which is used for setting up the initial conditions of a cosmological simulation.
The notebook calculates and visualizes the box size and grid setup,
considering Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) techniques to achieve the desired resolution.
